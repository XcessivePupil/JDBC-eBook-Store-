# JDBC-eBook-Store-
Using Java and MySQL to create an interactive database, that a bookstore clerk could use to add, update, delete or search for books. 

This was a really intertesting project and it provided an introduction to both JDBC and the SQL language. It was also a good opportunity to showcase some object oriented programming skills, in creating a menu based program.

If you are looking to create your first ever JDBC project, I reccomend completing this free course first:

https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-connect-java-jdbc-to-mysql/

It gives a great step by step breakdown of exactly how to connect to MySQL and how to query the database from there.
